Next, place the metal tent stake on top of the skewer and begin hammering the stake with the hammering surface (rock or log). With each hit, the stake will reshape the skewer into a pointed end, effectively creating a makeshift campfire poker. You can also use the sturdy stick as a handle for the skewer, placing it between the stick and the skewer to create a makeshift poker with a longer handle.
