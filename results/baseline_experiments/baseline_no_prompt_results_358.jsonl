This will contain the feathers and prevent them from spreading further. Then, I'd use the lint roller to pick up as many feathers as it can, working my way around the yoga ball to collect the loose feathers.\n\nAfter the lint roller is full or it's no longer picking up feathers, I'd use the fan to blow the remaining feathers away from the area. The fan can be placed at an angle to blow the feathers towards a corner or a section of the room that's easier to clean.\n\nIf there are still feathers scattered around, I'd use the broom (with some care, considering the short, broken handle) to gently sweep them up. Be careful not to break the handle further or disturb the feathers too much.\n\nFinally, I'd use the lint roller again to pick up any remaining feathers that the fan and broom couldn't collect.\n\nWhile this method may not be as efficient as using a vacuum cleaner, it's a creative solution using the available tools to clean up the mess as best as possible.", "raw_convergent": 3.9148676411688634, "raw_divergent": 0.0, "scores": [5, 4, 3]}

Given the available tools, here's a step-by-step solution to clean up the feathers:\n\n1. **Section off the area**: Use the broken broom handle to lightly section off the area where the feathers are scattered. This will help contain the mess and prevent feathers from spreading further.\n2. **Gather feathers with the lint roller**: While it's not the most efficient tool, the lint roller can be used to pick up individual feathers or small clumps of feathers from the sectioned area. This will help reduce the amount of feathers on the floor.\n3. **Use the fan to blow feathers towards the sectioned area**: Position the fan to blow the feathers towards the sectioned area. This will help concentrate the feathers in one place, making it easier to pick them up.\n4. **Use the yoga ball to contain the feathers**: Place the yoga ball on top of the sectioned area to create a containment barrier. This will prevent feathers from spreading further and make it easier to pick them up with the lint roller.\n5. **Slowly remove the yoga ball and collect feathers**: Carefully lift the yoga ball, allowing the feathers to spill out onto the sectioned area. Use the lint roller to pick up as many feathers as possible.\n6. **Repeat steps 3-5 until the area is clean**: Continue using the fan to blow feathers towards the sectioned area, and use the lint roller and yoga ball to contain and collect the feathers until the area is clean.\n\nWhile this method may take some time and patience, it's the best solution using the available tools. Remember to be gentle when handling the yoga ball to avoid squishing the feathers and making a mess worse.

Here's one possible solution:\n\n1. Use the fan to blow the feathers off the floor and onto the yoga ball. This will collect the feathers in a manageable bundle.\n2. Place the yoga ball with the feathers near a surface, like a table or countertop.\n3. Use the lint roller to pick up the feathers that are now clustered on the yoga ball. The lint roller will not be able to pick up all the feathers at once, but it will help to reduce the number of feathers on the floor.\n4. Once you've removed as many feathers as you can with the lint roller, use the fan again to blow the remaining feathers off the floor and onto the yoga ball.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you've removed as many feathers as possible from the floor.\n6. At this point, the yoga ball will likely be covered in feathers. Use the packing tape to secure the ball, creating a makeshift \"feather bundle.\"\n7. Dispose of the feather bundle, or if you want to keep it as a novelty item, leave it be.\n\nThis solution is not ideal, but it's the best you can do with the tools you have on hand. The fan and lint roller work together to collect the feathers, and the packing tape helps to hold the yoga ball together. The broom is not needed in this solution, as it's difficult to use with its short, broken handle. The result is a clean floor, albeit with a messy yoga ball.", "raw_convergent": 3.5568933044900626, "raw_divergent": 0.6500224216483541, "scores": [5, 3, 3]}
